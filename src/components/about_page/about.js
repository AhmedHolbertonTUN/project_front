    <h1>About BioMarket</h1>
    <p>When BioMarket opened its doors in 2012, it was our dream to offer the best and widest range of organic foods available, and our mission to promote health in the community and to bring a sense of discovery and adventure into food shopping. We hope that you find inspiration, excitement and good health from the food you eat, and learn, like us, that to eat well is to live better.</p>

    When we opened our doors in 2012, it was our dream to offer the best and widest range of organic foods available, and our mission to promote health in the community and to bring a sense of discovery and adventure into food shopping.  As most food production becomes increasingly industrialised, we want to bring back a sense of food that you can trust.</p>

    <h1>What We Believe</h1>
    <p>Our simple truth is that foods should be natural and wholesome. We advocate that food be authentic and ethical, freshly prepared and tasty – not a mere convenience.  We believe in ethical and sustainable farming and place great emphasis on the provenance of all our products.</p><br/>
    <p>We know that people who are discerning about what they eat want to make informed and responsible choices. Like us you believe that food wasn’t meant to be meddled with or tainted with chemicals. So we say no to artificial additives, hydrogenated fats, highly processed foods, and of course GM.  Instead at Planet Organic you’ll find nutritious, seasonal and organic food with the goodness intact. You’ll find wide ranges of natural health foods suitable for all speciality diets, as well as a ground-breaking raw foods range.</p><br/>
    <p>We hope that you find inspiration, excitement and good health from the food you eat and learn, like us, that to eat well is to live better.</p>
